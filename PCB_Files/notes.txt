Lights
- 5.5x2.1mm dc connector --> most common connector --> 12v als well as 5v supplys available
- option to switch between 12 and 5 volt --> buck converter if not 5v
- wemos d1 mini for all lights --> no neccessity for power saving due to power supply
- 5x n-mos for all pwm or on/off applications

- (option to attach multiple WS2812B strips) --> would require bitbang as no dma on other pins available

- basically two groups:
-- lights controlled using neopixel library like ws2812 or sk6812
-- lights controlled by pwm to n-mos up to 5-channels
-- (maybe spechial: 3 channels neopixel for rgb and 2 channels pwm for cct)
